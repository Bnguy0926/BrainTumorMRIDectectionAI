# BrainTumorMRIDectectionAI
ECS 170 Final Project

By Andrew Bender, Abhiram Borra, Arnav Kaushik, Britney Nguyen, & George Zavala

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning model that would classify brain MRI scans. We sought out to learn how to build a convolutional neuro-network that would provide us with a basic understanding of the applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare.

Throughout the process of developing this project, we learned about working with data and how to design and optimize a convultional neuro-network.
